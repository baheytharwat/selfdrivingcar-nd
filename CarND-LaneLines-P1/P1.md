#Overview

In this project, I will use the tools about computer version to identify lane lines on the road. I will develop a pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images).


### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. I converted the images to grayscale, Used GaussianBlur to blur the image to reduce the noise and smooth the image, Detected edges using Canny Edge detection, Created a Region of Interest which is a fixed space to look for the lane markings in this area according that the camera is fixed and Found lane lines using Hough Lines Transform.  

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by separating the detected lined to right lines and left lines. This was done using the slope of each line.  I get the average slope of all right lines and the average slope of all left lines and draw one line for each side according to their direction.

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

One potential shortcoming would be my pipeline can't find lane lines exactly when there are variation in brightness and contrast. 

Another shortcoming could be that Hough lines based on straight lines and doesn't work good for curved lines. There are too many paraments to be tuned, It will be too hard to find parameters to fit all the environments.

And some roads don't have lane marks.



### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to work with curved lines instead straight lines. lane lines prediction from previous frame can help to find the lanes in next steps.

Another potential improvement could be to create your own lane marks even if the road doesn't have one.
